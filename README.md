Ebiose is a **distributed artificial intelligence factory**, an open source project from the Inria‚Äôs incubator (French lab). Our vision: enabling humans and agents to collaborate in building tomorrow's AI in an open and democratic way.

> "AI can just as easily become the weapon of a surveillance capitalism dystopia as the foundation of a democratic renaissance."
 

üëÄ **Must read** üëÄ
- [Founding article](https://bit.ly/ebiose-blog-post) *(10 min)*
- [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) *(3 min)*
## üß™ Current status: Beta 0.1

This first beta version implements the foundations of our vision.

### ‚úÖ What's included

- **Architect agents**: Specialized AIs for designing and evolving other agents
- **Darwinian engine**: Evolutionary system enabling continuous improvement of agents through mutation and selection
- **Forges**: Isolated environments where architect agents create custom agents to solve specific problems
- **LangGraph Compatibility**: Integration with the LangGraph ecosystem for agent orchestration

### üö® Points of caution

- **Proof of concept**: Don't expect complex or production-ready agents
- **Initial architect agent to be improved**: The first implemented architect agent is still simple
- **Empty ecosystems**: For now, your forges start with unpopulated ecosystems
- **Early stage**: Be prepared to work through initial issues and contribute to improvements! üòá

# üöÄ Quick start

## üîß Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ebiose-ai/ebiose-core.git && cd ebiose
```

Ebiose uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a packaging and dependency manager. See [Astral's uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install it.  

If you don't want to use `uv`, you can still use the `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies with `pip` or `conda`.

## üì¶ Install Project Dependencies with uv

Once uv is installed, use it to install your project dependencies. In your project directory, run:

```sh
uv sync
```

For more detailed instructions or troubleshooting tips, refer to the [official uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

> üí° Pro Tip: You may need to add the root of the repository to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. Alternatively, use a `.env` file to do so.

## üîç Understand forges and forge cycles

The Jupyter notebook [quickstart.ipynb](notebooks/quickstart.ipynb) is the easiest way to understand the basics and start experimenting with Ebiose. This notebook lets you try out **architect agents** and **forges** on your very own challenges. ü§ì

## üõ†Ô∏è Implement your own forge

To go further, the `examples/` directory features a complete forge example designed to optimize agents that solve math problems. Check out `examples/[math_forge/math_forge.py](math_forge/math_forge.py)` for the implementation of the 'MathLangGraphForge' forge.

To run a cycle of the Math forge, execute the following command in your project directory:

```sh
uv run ./examples/math_forge/run.py
```

Once agents are written to the save path, evaluate an agent by executing:

```sh
uv run ./examples/math_forge/evaluate.py
```

Kick off your journey by implementing your own forge with the accompanying `compute_fitness` method! üéâ

## ü§ñ LLM model APIs support

As of today, the easiest way to experiment with Ebiose is to use the OpenAI API. Just set your OpenAI API key via an `.env` file or run:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

For support with other LLM providers, refer to [LangChain's API support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/) and modify our [LangChain backend implementation](ebiose/backends/langgraph/compute_intensive_batch_processor.py) as needed.

**All feedback is highly appreciated. Thanks! üéä**
