title: Our Vision
---

In the next decade, artificial intelligence will reshape our world. But who will decide what form it takes and for whose benefit?

At Ebiose, we believe in a different future. Instead of a world where AI is controlled by a few tech giants, we envision a future where AI is built collectively and openly.

Born within the French Inria research laboratory, Ebiose is a distributed AI factory where humans and agents collaborate to build a truly democratic and sustainable artificial intelligence.

We invite you to join us in this mission. Explore the foundations of Ebiose, and become an actor in this transformation.
