Ebiose is a distributed artificial intelligence factory where autonomous AI agents self-evolve. Here are the core concepts that make up the Ebiose ecosystem.

## Agents: The Building Blocks of Ebiose

An **Ebiose agent** is an autonomous, intelligent entity orchestrated by an **Agent Engine**. Think of them as the fundamental reusable building blocks of the Ebiose world. Agents can be simple or complex, and they can even be composed of other agents.

## Agent Engine: The Heart of an Agent

The **Agent Engine** is the central engine responsible for managing and executing an agent. Ebiose currently offers a graph-based Agent Engine using the LangGraph framework, but it's designed to be extensible, allowing for other engines like Autogen or CrewAI in the future.

## Architect Agents: The Master Builders

A **specialized agent** whose objective is to design, create, and evolve other agents within dedicated forges. Architect agents select and assemble existing building blocks to craft new agents and reusable components, fueling the continuous innovation and evolution of the Ebiose ecosystem.

## Forges & Forge Cycles: Where Agents Are Born

A **forge** is an isolated laboratory where custom agents are created to solve specific problems. Within each forge, Architect Agents orchestrate the creation and improvement of agents through a Darwinian process of evolution. This process happens in **forge cycles**, which are periods of evolution with a defined budget.

## Ecosystems & The Biosphere: A Living Network

An **ecosystem** is a distributed and living environment where agents evolve and compete. The **Ebiose Biosphere** is an interconnected network of all Ebiose ecosystems, forming a global system where innovations, agents, and knowledge can circulate and evolve.
