title: Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up your environment and running your first Ebiose forge cycle.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ebiose-ai/ebiose.git && cd ebiose
```

Ebiose uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a packaging and dependency manager. Make sure you have `uv` installed. You can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Once `uv` is installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Initialization

Next, initialize the project:

```bash
make init
```

This command will:

- Create a `model_endpoints.yml` file from the template. You'll need to edit this file to add your API keys.
- Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example`.

## Running Your First Forge Cycle

The easiest way to get started is to run the `math_forge` example. This example is designed to evolve agents that can solve math problems.

To run a cycle of the `math_forge`, execute the following command:

```bash
uv run ./examples/math_forge/run.py
```

This will start a forge cycle with a small budget. You should see the agents evolving and their fitness scores improving over time.

Congratulations! You've just run your first Ebiose forge cycle.
