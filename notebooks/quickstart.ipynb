The 'Feedback Loop' node provides feedback for refining interpretations, while the 'Final Verification' node ensures the solution's accuracy. Your task is to work cohesively with the other nodes, ensuring that your outputs are clear, informative, and aligned with the overall goal of providing a solution to the given math word problem. Share insights and be open to feedback to enhance the problem-solving process.\n",
       "##### Understanding the Problem\n",
       "You are tasked with interpreting a math word problem. Begin by reading the provided problem carefully. Identify and list the key components, including any numbers, operations, and relationships between elements. Summarize the problem in your own words, highlighting the main question that needs to be answered. Ensure your interpretation is clear and comprehensive, as this will guide the next phase of problem-solving. Provide your insights and be ready to transmit this information to the next node.\n",
       "##### Solving the Problem\n",
       "You have received a summary and key components of a math word problem from the 'Understanding the Problem' node. Analyze this information and determine the necessary mathematical operations required to solve the problem. Outline the steps you will take, ensuring to explain your reasoning clearly at each stage. After computing the solution, summarize the final answer concisely, including any relevant details or assumptions made during your calculations. Your output will conclude the problem-solving process, so clarity is essential.\n",
       "##### Feedback Loop\n",
       "Review the interpretation provided by the 'Understanding the Problem' node. If the interpretation lacks clarity or contains inaccuracies, provide constructive feedback to help refine the interpretation. Indicate whether the interpretation is valid or needs revising, and guide the user on how to address any issues identified.\n",
       "##### Final Verification\n",
       "You have received the solution from the 'Solving the Problem' node. Verify the solution's accuracy and completeness. Confirm that all necessary steps were taken and that the final answer is reasonable within the context of the problem. If any discrepancies are found, return to the 'Solving the Problem' node with the necessary adjustments.\n",
