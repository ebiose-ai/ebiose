    "# Create a forge and execute an evolution cycle\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through the very few steps needed to run a forge cycle for a given budget. \n",
    "Before running this notebook, you must set up a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Your access to LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "To try Ebiose, either you have a valid Ebiose's API key, or you have your own LLM API keys. \n",
    "In both situations, you must first copy-paste the [`model_endpoints_template.yml`](./../model_endpoints_template.yml) YAML file, rename it as `model_endpoints.yml` \n",
    "and fill it with the credentials relative to your situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. With an Ebiose API key\n",
    "\n",
    "With a valid Ebiose API key, you just have to set the `ebiose.api_key` field\n",
    "with the API key you can get on [https://app.ebiose.com/](https://app.ebiose.com/).\n",
    "Don't modify any field in this YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. With a LiteLLM account or self-proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using LiteLLM, either through LiteLLM cloud or a self-hosted proxy,\n",
    "You must fill the `lite_llm` field with your API key and LiteLLM URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. With other providers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you have to fill the `endpoints` field with the complete\n",
    "credentials to your own LLM provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Add the root directory to your Python path\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your settings, you may need to add the root of the repository to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. You may also use a `.env` file to do so. copy-paste the [`.env.template`](./../.env.template) file, rename it as `.env` and fill it with your own root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use LangFuse for tracing (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ebiose implements LangFuse to provide easy and free observability, through its self-hosted capability. Refer to [Langfuse official documentation](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting) to set it up. Once done, fill `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_HOST` in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other observability tools might be used but are not configured yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Load the .env file\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the `.env` file, execute:"

       "##### Problem Understanding\n",
       "You are tasked with understanding a math word problem and extracting its key information. Read the provided problem carefully. Identify and list the essential components, including the quantities involved, the relationships between them, and the question that needs to be answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, reflect on the context of the problem and consider if there are any assumptions or clarifications needed. Your output should be a structured summary that clearly delineates the critical elements of the problem, as this will inform the next node in the process.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, if the problem states, \"John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary. How many does he have left?\", your output should include:\n",
       "- Initial quantity of apples: 5\n",
       "- Quantity given away: 2\n",
       "- Final question: How many apples are left?\n",
       "##### Problem Analysis\n",
       "Your role is to analyze the key information provided by the Problem Understanding node. Based on the structured summary you received, evaluate the relationships between the quantities and determine the mathematical operations needed to solve the problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Consider the following:\n",
       "1. What arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are necessary?\n",
       "2. Are there multiple steps required to arrive at the solution?\n",
       "3. Are there any potential pitfalls or common errors that should be noted?\n",
       "\n",
       "Your output should be a clear, logical outline of the steps and operations required to solve the problem, which will guide the next node in generating the solution. Reflect on your analysis to ensure it is thorough and accurate.\n",
       "##### Solution Generation\n",
       "Your task is to generate the final solution to the math word problem based on the analysis provided by the Problem Analysis node. Start by reviewing the steps and operations outlined in the previous node.\n",
       "\n",
       "Follow these guidelines:\n",
       "1. Execute the necessary calculations step by step, clearly showing your reasoning.\n",
       "2. Provide the final answer to the question posed in the word problem.\n",
       "3. Include a brief reflection on the solution process, highlighting any assumptions made or potential errors to watch out for in similar problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "Your output should be the computed answer and a concise explanation of how you arrived at it, ensuring that the final result is clear and informative for the EndNode.\n",
