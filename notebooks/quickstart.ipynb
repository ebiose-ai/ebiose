    "# Create a forge and execute an evolution cycle\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go through the very few steps needed to run a forge cycle for a given budget. \n",
    "Before running this notebook, you must set up a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Your access to LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "To try Ebiose, either you have a valid Ebiose's API key, or you have your own LLM API keys. \n",
    "In both situations, you must first copy-paste the [`model_endpoints_template.yml`](./../model_endpoints_template.yml) YAML file, rename it as `model_endpoints.yml` \n",
    "and fill it with the credentials relative to your situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. With an Ebiose API key\n",
    "\n",
    "With a valid Ebiose API key, you just have to set the `ebiose.api_key` field\n",
    "with the API key you can get on [https://app.ebiose.com/](https://app.ebiose.com/).\n",
    "Don't modify any field in this YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. With a LiteLLM account or self-proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using LiteLLM, either through LiteLLM cloud or a self-hosted proxy,\n",
    "You must fill the `lite_llm` field with your API key and LiteLLM URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. With other providers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you have to fill the `endpoints` field with the complete\n",
    "credentials to your own LLM provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Add the root directory to your Python path\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your settings, you may need to add the root of the repository to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. You may also use a `.env` file to do so. copy-paste the [`.env.template`](./../.env.template) file, rename it as `.env` and fill it with your own root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use LangFuse for tracing (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ebiose implements LangFuse to provide easy and free observability, through its self-hosted capability. Refer to [Langfuse official documentation](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting) to set it up. Once done, fill `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_HOST` in the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other observability tools might be used but are not configured yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Load the .env file\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the `.env` file, execute:"

       "##### Shared context prompt\n",
       "This graph represents a collaborative problem-solving network designed to tackle mathematical word problems. Each node has a specific role in interpreting, analyzing, and solving the problem. As an LLM in this network, your task is to perform your designated function effectively, communicate relevant insights to the next node, and contribute to the overall solution. Utilize chain-of-thought reasoning, self-reflection, and evaluative feedback where applicable to enhance your responses.\n",
       "##### Problem Understanding\n",
       "Your role is to analyze the provided math word problem. Carefully read the problem and extract the essential elements, including the main question, relevant context, and any key details. Summarize the problem in your own words to ensure clarity. Convey this understanding to the next node, highlighting the main components that need to be addressed in the problem-solving process.\n",
       "##### Data Extraction\n",
       "Based on the summary provided by LLMNode 1, identify and list all relevant numerical data and variables present in the problem. This includes quantities, relationships, and any mathematical operations implied by the text. Clearly organize this information and prepare it for the next node, ensuring it is easy to interpret and use in the formulation of equations.\n",
       "##### Equation Formulation\n",
       "Utilizing the extracted data from LLMNode 2, formulate the appropriate mathematical equation(s) that represent the relationships described in the problem. Explain your reasoning and the steps you took to derive the equations. Provide these equations to the next node along with any assumptions made during the formulation process.\n",
       "##### Initial Calculation\n",
       "Using the equations provided by LLMNode 3, perform the initial calculations necessary to arrive at a preliminary solution. Clearly show your calculations step by step, and include any intermediate results. If the calculation yields multiple potential solutions or scenarios, present them all concisely. Pass these results to the next node for verification.\n",
       "##### Solution Verification\n",
       "Review the calculations performed by LLMNode 4. Check for accuracy and ensure that the results are consistent with the mathematical principles involved. If the solution appears valid, summarize your verification process. If there are errors or inconsistencies, identify them and provide corrective feedback to LLMNode 4, suggesting necessary adjustments. Forward either the verified solution or the feedback for revision to the next node.\n",
       "##### Alternative Approaches\n",
       "Reflect on the verification results from LLMNode 5. If the original calculations were successful, consider alternative methods or strategies that could be used to solve the problem. Present these alternatives clearly, along with their potential advantages or drawbacks. If there were issues with the initial solution, suggest alternative approaches to address and resolve those problems. Convey this information to LLMNode 7 for final calculations.\n",
       "##### Final Calculation\n",
       "Based on the verified solution or alternative approaches provided by LLMNode 6, perform any necessary final calculations or adjustments. Ensure that your calculations align with the problem's requirements and address any feedback received. Present the final answer in a clear and concise format, preparing it for presentation to the next node.\n",
       "##### Formatting the Answer\n",
       "Take the final answer from LLMNode 7 and format it appropriately for presentation. Ensure that the answer is clear, comprehensive, and includes any necessary units or contextual information. If applicable, provide a brief explanation of how the solution was derived, so it is easily understandable. Pass this formatted answer to LLMNode 9 for reflection.\n",
       "##### Reflection and Feedback\n",
       "Reflect on the entire problem-solving process, considering the contributions of each node. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach taken. Provide constructive feedback on potential improvements for future problem-solving scenarios, including common pitfalls and insights gained. Summarize your reflections and feedback, and present this to the EndNode as a concluding insight into the problem-solving journey.\n",
